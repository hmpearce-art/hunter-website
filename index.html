        <h2>Welcome to My Personal Growth Story</h2>
        <p>
          Hello My name is Hunter Pearce.  I'm a 20-year-old college student passionate about weightlifting and volleyball.
          Over the past few years, I've undergone a significant transformation, both physically and mentally. At one point I used to weigh around 360 pounds at 6,2 (Just shy of a calender year). I was unahppy 
          a lot of the time and felt very tired all the time. I wanted to make a change not for others but because I needed to for me.   
        </p>

      
This website follows my journey through weightlifting, volleyball, and personal development.
           <br> My goal is to inspire others by sharing not only my physical transformation, but also my 
            mindset shifts, challenges, and the habits that shaped my progress. </br>
        <p>
            Explore each section to see my timeline, training routines, mindset tools, and how far I've come. Thaanks for being here and let's get started
