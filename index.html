            <h2>Welcome to My Personal Growth Story</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is <strong>Hunter Pearce</strong>. I'm a 20-year-old college student passionate about
                weightlifting and volleyball.
            </p>

            <p>
                Not long ago, I weighed around <strong>360 pounds</strong> at 6'2". I was tired most of the time,
                unhappy with how I felt, and stuck in unhealthy routines. Eventually, I realized I needed to change —
                not for anyone else, but for myself.
            </p>

            <p>
                This website shares my journey of weight loss, strength training, volleyball, mindset growth, and
                becoming a healthier version of myself both mentally and physically.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thanks for being here. Explore the pages above to see how far I've come — and how far I plan to go.
