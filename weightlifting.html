                <h2>Starting with Small Steps</h2>
                <p>
                    When I began my journey, I didn’t jump into extreme workouts. Instead, I started with simple habits
                    like walking 10,000 steps a day and focusing on a caloric deficit. These small actions built the
                    foundation for everything that came later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned quickly that you don’t need complicated routines to lose weight. Consistency, discipline,
                    and healthier decisions are what make the biggest impact.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I made small but meaningful swaps in my daily life. I replaced sugary snacks with Tic Tacs, switched
                    soda for Diet Coke, and had tea at night instead of a heavy meal. These small changes added up fast.

                <p>
                    Hitting 300 pounds was one of my biggest emotional victories. The gym slowly became something I
                    looked forward to, not something I dreaded.
