        <h2>Starting with Small Steps</h2>
        <p>When I started my journey, I didn’t jump into extreme workouts. Instead, I began with simple habits like walking. I committed to 10,000 steps a day, and most importantly, I maintained a caloric deficit. I’ve learned that you don’t have to do complicated routines to lose weight; consistency and small changes are the key. One of my favorite quotes is, “Gains are made in the gym, but weight loss happens in the kitchen.”</p>

        <h2>Adapting to a Healthier Lifestyle</h2>
        <p>Instead of indulging in sweets or sugary drinks, I switched to Tic Tacs and Diet Coke. At night, I would opt for a cup of tea instead of a full meal before bed. These small swaps made a significant difference in my journey. Tracking my weight weekly motivated me to stay on track, and I saw incremental progress that fueled my desire to keep going.</p>

        <h2>Hitting Milestones</h2>
        <p>One of the biggest milestones in my journey was hitting 300 pounds. It was a huge mental win for me. It marked a point where I realized I truly enjoyed the gym. It became something I looked forward to, knowing that the effort would pay off in the long run. The gym was no longer a chore—it was part of my routine, and I loved it.</p>
