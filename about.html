        <h2>Growing Up in a Food-Centered Family</h2>
        <p>I grew up in a family that loved food,and I mean loved food. We would eat to cope with stress, boredom, or simply for enjoyment. This slowly cascaded to unhealthy eating habits that I used as an excuse to get out of shape. Food became a comfort and an everyday escape, but it was also slowly destroying my health. My family didn’t criticize me.They were just going along with the same patterns and nothing was changing. It wasn’t until later that I realized how much this behavior was taking away from my life and that this path was a path cut short.</p>

        <h2>My Toxic Relationship That Changed My Life</h2>
        <p>The real turning point for me came during a toxic relationship. It started off rocky, but it wasn't until she broke up with me on Christmas morning and later found out she had cheated that everything clicked for me. I realized how much I was holding onto a relationship that didn’t help me. I was unhealthy, and so was my mindset. My self-confidence was rock bottom, and that needed to change.</p>

        <h2>The Realization and the Decision to Change</h2>
        <p>It was in that moment of pain that I realized I had to change, not just for others, but for myself. I wasn’t ready for a relationship, and I wasn’t ready to be my best self. That’s when I started making small changes to my diet and lifestyle, focusing on improving both my mind and body.</p>
