            <h2>Growing Up in a Food-Centered Family</h2>
            <p>
                I grew up in a family that loved food, and I mean <em>loved</em> food. We would eat to cope with stress,
                boredom, or simply for enjoyment. Over time, this turned into unhealthy eating habits that I used as an
                excuse to get out of shape.
            </p>
            <p>
                Food became a comfort and an everyday escape, but it was also slowly destroying my health. My family
                didn’t criticize me—they were just going along with the same patterns, and nothing was changing.
                Eventually, I realized how much this behavior was taking away from my life and that this path was a
                path cut short.

            <h2>My Toxic Relationship That Changed My Life</h2>
            <p>
                A turning point came during a toxic relationship. It started off rocky, but it wasn’t until she broke up
                with me on Christmas morning—and I later found out she had cheated—that everything clicked.
            </p>
            <p>
                I realized how much I was holding onto a relationship that didn’t help me. I was unhealthy, and so was
                my mindset. My self-confidence was at rock bottom, and that had to change.
            </p>

            <h2>The Realization and the Decision to Change</h2>
            <p>
                In that moment of pain, I realized I had to change, not just for others, but for myself. I wasn’t ready
                for a healthy relationship, and I wasn’t being my best self.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s when I started making small changes to my diet and lifestyle, focusing on improving both my mind
                and body. Those small steps are what led me to where I am today.
