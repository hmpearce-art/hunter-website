                <h2>Shifting My Mindset</h2>
                <p>
                    For most of my life, I sought validation from others. I cared about what people thought of me
                    and how they saw me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I came across a quote that changed my perspective:
                </p>
                <p class="quote">
                    “Why do you care if everyone likes you? You don’t even like everyone.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    That really stuck with me. I realized that seeking validation from others isn’t the path to true
                    happiness. It’s about understanding and accepting yourself for who you are.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Building a Routine of Self-Discipline</h2>
                <p>
                    With weight loss and volleyball, building a routine helped me create a sense of discipline and
                    control in my life. I started looking forward to the gym and volleyball practices, which made it
                    easier to get through tough times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Knowing that something good was coming — a training session, a game, or just movement — made the
                    rest of life feel more manageable.
                </p>

                <h2>Growth Beyond the Gym</h2>
                <p>
                    This journey has been about more than just physical transformation. It’s been about mental growth too.
                    Developing the self-discipline to stick with my goals has made me more confident, happier, and more
                    content with who I am.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a journey that continues to shape who I am, and I’m excited for where it leads next.

                <h2>Finding Peace in Nature</h2>
                <p>
                    Nature has been a huge part of resetting my mind and stepping back from stress. These moments remind
                    me to slow down, breathe, and appreciate how far I’ve come.
