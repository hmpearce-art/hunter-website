        <h2>Shifting My Mindset</h2>
        <p>For most of my life, I sought validation from others. I cared about what people thought of me, how they saw me. But then, I came across a quote that changed my perspective: “Why do you care if everyone likes you? You don’t even like everyone.” That really stuck with me. I realized that seeking validation from others isn’t the path to true happiness. It’s about understanding and accepting yourself for who you are.</p>

        <h2>Building a Routine of Self-Discipline</h2>
        <p>With weight loss and volleyball, building a routine helped me create a sense of discipline and control in my life. I started looking forward to the gym and volleyball practices, and that made it easier to get through the tough times. Knowing that something good was coming made the rest of life feel more manageable.</p>

        <h2>Growth Beyond the Gym</h2>
        <p>This journey has been about more than just physical transformation. It’s been about mental growth, too. Developing the self-discipline to stick with my goals has made me more confident, happier, and more content with who I am. This is a journey that continues to shape who I am, and I’m excited for where it leads next.</p>
